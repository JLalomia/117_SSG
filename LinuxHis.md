## History Behind Linux
### WHO
- Developed by: Linus Torvalds, a Finnish software engineer.
#### Key Figures:
- Linus Torvalds: Creator of the Linux kernel and primary figure in its early development.
- Richard Stallman: Founded the Free Software Foundation and promoted the concept of free software, which influenced Linux's development philosophy.
### WHAT
- Linux: An open-source operating system kernel that serves as the core component of various operating systems known as Linux distributions (distros). It allows users to interact with the hardware of a computer and manage system resources.
- Unix-like System: Linux is designed to be similar to Unix, providing a multi-user environment with multitasking capabilities.
### WHY
- Need for a Free OS: Linus Torvalds aimed to create a free and open alternative to the MINIX operating system, which was used for educational purposes but had licensing restrictions.
- Community Collaboration: The idea of open-source software encouraged collaboration and contributions from developers worldwide, fostering innovation and improvement.
### WHEN
- Development Start: Linux development began in 1991 when Linus Torvalds announced the project on the comp.os.minix newsgroup.
- First Release: The first version of the Linux kernel (0.01) was released in September 1991.
- Version Milestones: The first stable version (1.0) was released in March 1994.
### WHERE
- Origin: Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland, where he was studying computer science at the University of Helsinki.
- Global Development: After its release, Linux became a global project with developers contributing from around the world. Its open-source nature allowed it to spread rapidly, with major contributions coming from countries like the United States, Germany, Brazil, and India.
- Widespread Use: Linux is now used globally across different sectors, including in:
    - Data Centers and Cloud Computing (Amazon Web Services, Google, Facebook).
    - Supercomputing (dominates the TOP500 supercomputers worldwide).
    - Consumer Devices (Android phones, smart TVs, and various IoT devices).

### HOW
- Open Source Model: Linux is developed collaboratively, with its source code publicly available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
- Community Contributions: Developers around the world contribute to Linux by submitting patches, bug reports, and enhancements, creating a robust ecosystem.
- Distribution Variants: Numerous Linux distributions have emerged, each tailored for specific use cases, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat, and CentOS
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- Server Operating Systems: Linux powers a significant portion of web servers, including those running major websites and services due to its stability, security, and performance.
- Embedded Systems: Linux is widely used in embedded systems, such as routers, smart TVs, and IoT devices, because of its lightweight nature and flexibility.
- Supercomputers: As of 2023, Linux is the dominant operating system on supercomputers, with over 90% of the TOP500 list running Linux due to its performance and scalability.
- Development Platforms: Linux provides a development environment for software engineers, especially for open-source software development, supporting a wide range of programming languages and tools.
### IMPORTANCE
- Free and Open Source: Linux promotes the principles of free and open-source software, encouraging community involvement and innovation while reducing software costs.
- Flexibility and Customization: Users can customize and configure Linux distributions to meet specific needs, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- Security and Stability: Linux is known for its security and stability, making it a preferred choice for servers, enterprise applications, and critical systems.
