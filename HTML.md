## History Behind HTML
* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
* The inventor of HTML was Tim Berners-Lee in 1993
    * It was created to provide a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, etc
* Another version is XHTML, which is a rewrite of HTML as an XML language
    * XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup language
## Commands, What they do, and Examples:
| Command | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<h1> to <h6>` | These are heading tags used to define headings in HTML, with `<h1>` being the largest (main heading) and `<h6>` being the smallest | `<h1>This is an H1 heading</h1>` - "This is an H1 heading" appears large and bold |
| `<p>` | The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph in HTML. It automatically adds some space before and after the content | `<p>This is a paragraph of text. It is used to group sentences together.</p>` - The text appears as a paragraph with space around it |
| `<a>` | The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks. The `href` attribute defines the URL of the link | `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>` - "Visit Example Website" is a clickable link that navigates to the link when clicked|
| `<img>` | The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The `src` attribute specifies the image URL, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text if the image can't load | `<img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example Image" />` - An image is displayed from the URL provided in `src`. If the image fails to load, the alt text "Example Image" is shown |
| `<ul> and <li>` | The `<ul>` tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list, and `<li> is used to define each list item | `<ul> <li>First item</li> <li>Second item</li> <li>Third item</li> </ul>` - A bulleted list appears with "First item," "Second item," and "Third item" as separate bullet points |
