## History Behind Gopher
### WHO
- Developed by: University of Minnesota team, led by Mark P. McCahill, along with other faculty and students.
#### Key Figures:
- Mark P. McCahill: Principal developer and advocate for the Gopher protocol.
- University of Minnesota: The institution where Gopher was created and maintained.
### WHAT
- Gopher: A distributed document delivery protocol designed to facilitate the organization and retrieval of text-based information over the internet.
- It provided a hierarchical, menu-based interface for users to navigate through documents and files, primarily text
### WHY
- Information Retrieval: Gopher was created to improve the way users could access and organize the growing amount of information available on the internet, especially in the early 1990s.
- User-Friendly Navigation: The goal was to provide a simpler alternative to navigating the more complex and less organized World Wide Web (WWW) at the time, which was still in its infancy.
### WHEN
- Development Start: Gopher was developed in 1991 at the University of Minnesota.
- Launch: The first version was released in January 1992.
- Popularity Peak: Gopher gained significant popularity in the early to mid-1990s, before declining in favor of the World Wide Web by the late 1990s
### HOW
- Menu-Based Interface: Gopher used a menu-driven interface that allowed users to navigate through a series of menus to access text files, images, and other documents, making it more straightforward than the early web browsers.
- Client-Server Model: Gopher operated on a client-server model where Gopher clients would request documents from Gopher servers, which would then deliver the requested content.
- Protocol Simplicity: It was based on a relatively simple set of rules for how information was structured and accessed, making it easier for content creators to set up servers and publish content.
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- Gopher Client Software: Various Gopher clients were developed, allowing users to access Gopher servers, including Gopher+ and TurboGopher.
- Hierarchical Structure: Gopher sites organized information in a clear hierarchy, which was beneficial for academic and research institutions to share resources and documentation.
- Gopher Archives: Many educational institutions and libraries created Gopher servers to provide access to databases, research papers, and educational materials.
- Gopher Servers: Notable early Gopher servers included the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Gopher server, which served as a primary hub for Gopher content.
### IMPORTANCE
- Precursor to the Web: Gopher played a significant role in the evolution of information retrieval systems on the internet and was one of the earliest attempts to organize and present online information.
- Influence on Web Development: While Gopher eventually declined with the rise of the World Wide Web and HTML, it influenced the design of web interfaces and document retrieval systems.
- Educational Resource Sharing: It served as an important tool for universities and libraries to share research and resources, facilitating early academic collaboration and information dissemination.
