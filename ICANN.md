## History Behind ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

### **WHO**:
- **ICANN** is a **non-profit organization** responsible for coordinating the global domain name system (DNS) and IP address allocations.
  
#### **Key Figures**:
- **Jon Postel**: Pioneered the Domain Name System (DNS) and was integral to ICANN’s early efforts in coordinating DNS.
- **Esther Dyson**: First Chairwoman of ICANN’s Board of Directors.

### **WHAT**:
- **ICANN**: A central authority that oversees the allocation and management of **domain names**, **IP addresses**, and **protocol parameter assignments**.
  
- **Primary Functions**:
  - **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Coordinates the DNS root, ensuring that internet users can access websites through human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) instead of numerical IP addresses.
  - **IP Address Allocation**: Manages the distribution of **IP addresses** (IPv4 and IPv6) to ensure the internet remains functional globally.
  - **Accrediting Domain Registrars**: Approves and oversees domain name registrars, entities that sell domain names to the public.
  - **Protocol Assignment**: Ensures that technical identifiers, such as protocol numbers, are allocated consistently across the internet.
  
- **What ICANN is NOT**: ICANN does not control the content on the internet, regulate access to the internet, or manage bandwidth.


### **WHY**:
- **Need for Central Coordination**: As the internet grew globally in the 1990s, there was an urgent need for an organization to coordinate the complex technical infrastructure that supports the internet, such as domain name registration and IP address allocation. This was previously managed by various individuals and organizations, like Jon Postel, but a more formal body was required as the internet became a global public resource.

- **Prevent Fragmentation**: ICANN ensures that the internet remains a unified and globally accessible system by maintaining a consistent and coordinated approach to managing domain names and IP addresses. Without such coordination, different countries or regions could potentially create incompatible networks.


### **WHEN**:
- **Formation**: ICANN was officially formed on **September 18, 1998**. It was created to take over functions previously handled by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**, which Jon Postel managed, and other entities that helped administer the domain name system.
  
- **Milestones**:
  - **1998**: ICANN’s official creation, following a memorandum of understanding with the **U.S. Department of Commerce** to oversee DNS and IP address allocation.
  - **2000**: ICANN begins accrediting domain name registrars to decentralize the registration process.
  - **2009**: ICANN entered into the **Affirmation of Commitments** with the U.S. government, increasing its accountability and transparency.
  - **2016**: The **IANA stewardship transition** occurred, in which ICANN assumed full control over the coordination of the DNS, marking a major step toward the internationalization of internet governance.


### **WHERE**:
- **Headquarters**: ICANN is headquartered in **Los Angeles, California**.
  
- **Global Reach**: Although based in the U.S., ICANN has a global presence and works with stakeholders from around the world, including governments, businesses, and civil society. ICANN also holds regular international meetings where stakeholders gather to discuss internet governance issues.

### **HOW**:
- **Bottom-Up Multistakeholder Model**: ICANN operates under a multistakeholder model where governments, private companies, civil society, and the technical community all contribute to decision-making. This model is intended to ensure that no single entity (such as a government or corporation) has unilateral control over internet governance.
  
- **Policy Development Process**: ICANN develops policies through various working groups and advisory committees. These groups bring together experts and representatives from different parts of the internet ecosystem to develop consensus-based policies.
  
- **IANA Functions**: ICANN oversees the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**, which manages the DNS root zone, assigns IP addresses, and allocates protocol numbers. This role ensures the technical stability and interoperability of the global internet.
  
- **Accreditation of Registrars**: ICANN works with registrars (companies that sell domain names to the public) and ensures that domain names are registered and maintained in a fair and transparent manner.
  
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: ICANN is responsible for overseeing the allocation of **generic top-level domains (gTLDs)** (like .com, .org) and **country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs)** (like .uk, .de). It also introduced new gTLDs (e.g., .tech, .shop) to expand the availability of domain names.

### **EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS**:
- **Domain Name System**: ICANN’s most visible contribution has been maintaining and expanding the **Domain Name System**. It ensures that when users type in a web address (e.g., www.google.com), their browser can find the correct IP address to connect to the server hosting that website.
  
- **Expansion of gTLDs**: In the early 2000s, ICANN expanded the number of available generic top-level domains (e.g., .info, .biz) and, more recently, launched new gTLDs, allowing brands and organizations to create custom domain extensions (e.g., .google, .shop).
  
- **IANA Stewardship Transition**: In **2016**, the **U.S. government** transitioned control of the **IANA** functions to ICANN, effectively giving ICANN full control over the technical management of the DNS. This move was seen as a significant step towards the internationalization of internet governance.
  
- **Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)**: ICANN introduced support for **Internationalized Domain Names**, which allow domain names to be written in non-Latin scripts (e.g., Arabic, Chinese), making the internet more inclusive for non-English-speaking communities.

### **IMPORTANCE**:
- **Global Internet Governance**: ICANN plays a critical role in ensuring the **stability, security, and interoperability** of the global internet. By overseeing domain names, IP addresses, and protocol parameters, ICANN ensures that the internet functions as a cohesive, global system.
  
- **Preventing Fragmentation**: ICANN’s work prevents the internet from becoming fragmented. Without centralized coordination, countries or regions could have created incompatible or competing domain name systems and IP address allocations, undermining the global connectivity of the internet.
  
- **Inclusivity and Multistakeholder Model**: ICANN’s governance structure allows for input from various stakeholders, ensuring that decisions about the future of the internet are made in a transparent, inclusive, and collaborative manner.
