## History Behind Nuclear Weapons
### WHO
* United States, Soviet Union, and other major world powers, primarily during the Cold War
* Scientists like Robert Oppenheimer (U.S.) and Andrei Sakharov (Soviet Union) played major roles in nuclear weapons development
* Military and Defense Agencies like the U.S. Department of Defense and research institutions (Los Alamos Laboratory, etc.) were central to nuclear strategy and innovation
### WHAT
* Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction powered by nuclear reactions—either fission (atomic bombs) or fusion (hydrogen bombs)
* The invention of nuclear weapons in the 1940s and their proliferation during the Cold War created the need for highly secure and resilient communication systems.
* Concern over nuclear strikes and command-and-control disruptions spurred the development of robust, decentralized communication networks, ultimately leading to the internet’s foundations
### WHY
* The fear of nuclear war and the potential for large-scale destruction prompted the U.S. government to seek secure communication methods that could survive a nuclear strike
* If nuclear conflict destroyed key communication hubs, the military still needed to maintain command and control over their nuclear arsenal, ensuring no interruption in decision-making or retaliation
### WHEN
* Nuclear weapons were first developed during World War II, with the U.S. successfully detonating the first atomic bomb in 1945 (Manhattan Project)
* The Cold War era (late 1940s to 1991) saw intense nuclear arms races, particularly between the U.S. and the Soviet Union
* During the 1960s, the heightened fear of nuclear war led to innovations in communications, particularly DARPA’s focus on survivable networks
### HOW
* Concerns about centralized communication systems being destroyed in a nuclear attack led to the concept of a decentralized network that could reroute information even if parts were damaged
* This concept led to the development of packet-switching technology, in which data is broken into packets and sent across multiple nodes, allowing it to avoid disrupted areas—a key concept later used in the development of the internet
* ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency, later DARPA) funded the creation of ARPANET, a network designed to survive large-scale attacks, which became the foundation of the modern internet
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
* Cold War nuclear strategy directly influenced the development of survivable communication networks. The U.S. military's need for communication systems that could withstand a nuclear attack was one of the key motivators behind the research and development of decentralized networking protocols
* ARPANET: The precursor to the internet, created by ARPA in 1969, was designed with the goal of being robust and decentralized, so communications could continue even if parts of the network were destroyed in a nuclear strike
* Packet Switching: This method of breaking information into packets, sending it across various routes, and reassembling it at the destination, was developed in part to maintain communications in the event of a nuclear conflict. It became the core technology behind the internet
* RAND Corporation (early 1960s): RAND researchers, such as Paul Baran, were tasked with developing secure communication methods. Baran’s work on distributed networks became a foundation for the packet-switching concept
### IMPORTANCE TO PRE-INTERNET DEVELOPMENT
* Survivability: The fear of nuclear destruction shaped the design of early communication systems, which needed to function even if large portions were destroyed. This concept of survivability is critical to the architecture of the internet
* Decentralization: Pre-internet systems were centralized, but the potential for nuclear strikes on central hubs forced the development of decentralized communication systems, which could continue functioning even if parts were destroyed
* National Security: The need for secure, reliable communication between military and government agencies during the Cold War drove investment in research and innovation, which spilled over into civilian technologies, eventually leading to the creation of the internet
