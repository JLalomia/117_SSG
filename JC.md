## History of JC Licklider
### WHO
* J.C.R. Licklider (1915-1990) was an American psychologist and computer scientist, often referred to as one of the "fathers of the internet"
    * His ideas shaped the development of interactive computing and networking
### WHAT
* Licklider is best known for his work on interactive computing and the concept of a "man-computer symbiosis"—the idea that computers should enhance human intellect and allow people to interact directly with machines
* He played a key role in the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.
    * As the head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at DARPA, he funded early research into time-sharing computers and networking
### WHY
* Licklider believed that computers should not just be tools for calculation but partners in human problem-solving. He wanted to make computers more accessible, user-friendly, and connected, facilitating collaboration among people across different locations
* His vision was driven by a belief that such technology would lead to a better understanding and use of human knowledge.
### WHEN
* In the 1960s, during his time at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), Licklider’s ideas began to influence the course of computer science
    * His landmark paper, "Man-Computer Symbiosis", was published in 1960, laying the groundwork for his future contributions
    * Licklider’s direct influence on networking, especially ARPANET, happened from 1962-1964, when he was at DARPA. He also returned to DARPA in 1973 for a second stint
### HOW
* Through his role at DARPA, Licklider secured funding and support for key researchers and projects that laid the foundation for modern computing and networking (e.g., time-sharing systems, packet switching)
* His management style encouraged collaboration between academic institutions, government, and private industry, helping to bring together the community that would later develop the internet
* He was an early proponent of time-sharing systems, allowing multiple users to interact with a single computer system simultaneously—a precursor to modern computing environments
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
* ARPANET: Licklider’s vision of a connected system of computers became reality with the development of ARPANET in the late 1960s, which eventually evolved into the internet
* "Man-Computer Symbiosis": His 1960 paper was a foundational work envisioning the close collaboration between humans and machines, which still resonates today in fields like human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence
* Time-sharing systems: Licklider’s push for time-sharing computers led to the development of systems that allowed multiple people to use computers at once, moving away from batch processing, making computers much more user-friendly
