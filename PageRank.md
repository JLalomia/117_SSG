## History Behind Google Search's "Page Rank"
### WHO
- Developed by: Larry Page and Sergey Brin, co-founders of Google.
#### Key Figures:
- Larry Page: Co-founder of Google, who played a significant role in developing PageRank.
- Sergey Brin: Co-founder of Google, who collaborated with Page in creating the search engine and its algorithms.
### WHAT
- Google Search: A web search engine that became the most widely used search engine globally, known for its speed, simplicity, and relevance of search results.
- PageRank: An algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in its search results. It measures the importance of web pages based on the number and quality of links to them
### WHY
- Need for Improved Search Relevance: In the late 1990s, existing search engines often returned irrelevant results, leading to the need for a more sophisticated ranking system that could improve search relevance.
- Focus on Link Analysis: Page and Brin believed that the structure of the web itself, through hyperlinks, could be used to determine the importance and authority of web pages.
### WHEN
- Development Start: PageRank was developed in 1996 while Page and Brin were PhD students at Stanford University.
- Google Launch: Google was founded in September 1998, with PageRank as a core component of its search algorithm.
### WHERE
- **Stanford University, California, USA**: The idea for PageRank was developed while Larry Page and Sergey Brin were PhD students at Stanford University in 1996. This academic setting provided the foundation for their research into search engine algorithms and link analysis.
- **Google Headquarters, Mountain View, California, USA**: Once Google was founded in 1998, the company’s early work on PageRank and the search engine's development took place in Silicon Valley, where Google’s headquarters are located.
- **Global Impact**: Though developed in the United States, PageRank and Google’s search technology quickly became globally influential, affecting how websites across the world are ranked and discovered. Google's reach expanded to become the dominant search engine in nearly every country, with localized versions of the search engine in various languages and regions. 
- **The World Wide Web**: The PageRank algorithm was designed to analyze the entire web's hyperlink structure, making the "where" in a broader sense the entire internet, as the algorithm evaluated the interconnectedness of websites around the globe.

### HOW
- Link Analysis: PageRank works by analyzing the quantity and quality of links to a web page. Pages that are linked to by many other important pages receive a higher rank.
- Mathematical Model: The algorithm uses a mathematical formula to calculate a "rank" for each page based on its link structure, iteratively refining the scores to determine the final rankings.
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- Search Result Relevance: PageRank significantly improved the relevance of search results compared to earlier search engines, which often relied on keyword frequency alone.
- Influence on Web Design: The importance of backlinks encouraged webmasters to focus on link-building strategies, changing how websites were designed and marketed.
- Foundation for Further Innovations: PageRank laid the groundwork for subsequent algorithms and updates that further refined search results, including concepts like semantic search and machine learning integration.
### IMPORTANCE
- Revolutionizing Search: PageRank revolutionized the way search engines evaluated and ranked web pages, helping Google quickly rise to dominance in the search market.
- Impact on the Web: The emphasis on links changed the web landscape, leading to the growth of SEO (search engine optimization) practices that are vital for online visibility today.
- Ongoing Evolution: While PageRank remains a foundational aspect of Google’s search algorithm, the search engine has evolved to incorporate various other ranking factors and machine learning technologies to continually improve user experience.
