## History of Arpanet
### WHO
- Developed by: The United States Department of Defense’s ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), specifically its Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO).
- ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency): Funded and oversaw the development of ARPANET. ARPA is part of the U.S. Department of Defense.
#### Key Figures:
- J.C.R. Licklider: An early advocate for computer networking and interactive computing, who envisioned a network of computers.
- Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf: Later contributed to the development of the TCP/IP protocols that formed the backbone of ARPANET.
- Leonard Kleinrock: Played a significant role in packet-switching theory and the first message sent over ARPANET
- Bob Taylor: Director at ARPA who pushed for the creation of a network that would allow computers to share resources.
- Larry Roberts: A key ARPA scientist responsible for developing ARPANET’s design and implementation.
### WHAT
- ARPANET: The first operational packet-switching network, which laid the groundwork for the modern internet.
- Packet Switching: A method of grouping data into packets that are sent over a network and reassembled at the destination, allowing efficient data transmission
- Creation of ARPANET: ARPANET was the first operational packet-switching network, designed to allow multiple computers to communicate over long distances without requiring a direct connection between them. It introduced the concept of packet switching, where data is broken into smaller packets that are sent across different routes and reassembled at the destination.
- Goal: The original goal was to connect research institutions to share computing resources, facilitate collaboration, and increase the resilience of communication networks in the event of disruptions, including military attacks.
### WHY
- Need for Communication: To facilitate communication and resource sharing among research institutions and military organizations in the U.S. during the Cold War.
- Decentralization: To create a communication system that could withstand potential disruptions (like a nuclear attack), making it resilient against failures
- Resource Sharing: The primary motivation was to allow researchers at different institutions to share expensive computing resources, such as supercomputers, which were not widely available.
- Military Necessity: The network was also seen as a way to ensure communication survivability in the event of military conflict, specifically a nuclear attack, which might destroy centralized communication hubs. Decentralized communication would allow messages to be routed even if parts of the network were destroyed.
- Innovation in Networking: ARPANET also served as a testbed for new ideas about computer networking, data transmission, and resource sharing.
### WHEN
- Conceptualization: The idea for ARPANET was proposed in the early 1960s, with serious planning beginning in 1966.
- First Successful Connection: The first successful message was sent between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969.
- Official Launch: ARPANET became operational and expanded through the 1970s and 1980s, becoming the foundational technology for the internet
- 1969: ARPANET’s first successful connection was established. This year marked the beginning of the first packet-switching network, connecting universities and research institutions.
    - October 29, 1969: The first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which is considered the first successful connection between nodes.
- Late 1960s to 1970s: ARPANET expanded to connect more universities and government research facilities, evolving as more nodes were added and more applications, such as email, were developed.
### WHERE
- United States: ARPANET initially connected universities and research institutions in the U.S.
    - The first four nodes of ARPANET were located at UCLA, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah.
- First Connection: The first connection between nodes took place between UCLA and Stanford in California, marking the first time two computers communicated using packet switching.
### HOW
- Funding and Development: ARPA funded research at various universities and private contractors, encouraging collaboration and innovation.
- Network Design: ARPANET was designed using a decentralized architecture, allowing multiple nodes to communicate without relying on a central hub.
- Packet Switching: ARPANET used packet switching, breaking down data into small packets, sending them individually across the network, and reassembling them at their destination. This was more efficient and resilient than the traditional circuit-switched systems used by telephone networks.
- IMP (Interface Message Processors): ARPANET used IMPs, specialized computers that handled the routing of packets between nodes. These devices made packet switching possible by routing data across the network.
- First Message: On October 29, 1969, the first message sent over ARPANET was “LO” (the system crashed after the first two letters of "LOGIN" were transmitted) from UCLA to Stanford.
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- First Message: The first message sent over ARPANET was a simple "LOGIN" attempt between UCLA and Stanford, which crashed the system after sending just the first two letters.
- Email: The introduction of electronic mail (email) as a communication method over ARPANET by Ray Tomlinson in 1971, which became a vital application of the network.
- TCP/IP Implementation: The adoption of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in 1983, which standardized communication across networks and paved the way for the development of the modern internet.
    - In the 1970s, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed TCP/IP, the communication protocols that would later replace ARPANET’s original protocols and become the foundation of the modern internet.
- Networking Protocols: Development of several networking protocols that are still in use today, including FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and Telnet for remote access.
- Expansion and Influence: By the late 1970s and early 1980s, ARPANET connected multiple universities and research centers, influencing the growth of commercial networks and leading to the eventual development of the global internet
- First Operational Packet-Switching Network: ARPANET was the first large-scale implementation of packet switching, proving that it could work across multiple, geographically distant nodes.
- Email (1971): One of the earliest applications developed on ARPANET was email, created in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson, which allowed users to send messages to each other across the network.
### IMPORTANCE
- Foundation of the Internet: ARPANET is considered the precursor to the modern internet, demonstrating the feasibility of packet-switched networking and setting the stage for future technologies.
- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Fostered collaboration between computer scientists, engineers, and researchers, significantly impacting technological advancements and innovations.
- Military and Academic Use: Initially focused on defense and research, its applications quickly spread to academia and the private sector, fundamentally changing how people communicate and share information
- Decentralized Communication: The network’s decentralized structure allowed for more resilient communication and was designed to continue functioning even if parts of the network were destroyed, a key concern during the Cold War.
- Catalyst for Further Innovation: ARPANET provided a platform for developing early internet applications such as email, file sharing, and remote access, which laid the groundwork for the networked world we live in today.
