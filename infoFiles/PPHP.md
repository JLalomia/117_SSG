# History Behind Pearl and PHP Server
## Perl
### WHO
- Who:
Developed by: Larry Wall, an American programmer.
#### Key Figures:
- Larry Wall: Created Perl while working as a systems administrator to make report processing easier.
### WHAT
- Perl: A high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its text processing capabilities, used extensively for web development, system administration, and network programming.
- Scripting Language: Often referred to as a “glue language,” Perl excels at integrating and manipulating different systems and software.
### WHY
- Text Manipulation: Perl was designed to handle text processing tasks, making it ideal for reporting and parsing text files.
- Ease of Use: Larry Wall aimed to create a language that was easy to learn and use for both novice and experienced programmers.
### WHEN
- Development Start: Perl was first developed in 1987.
- Version Releases:
    - Perl 5 was released in 1994, introducing many features that solidified its popularity, including object-oriented programming.
### WHERE
- NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL): Larry Wall developed Perl while working as a systems administrator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where the need for text manipulation and reporting in systems administration inspired its creation.
- Global Use: Perl quickly gained popularity worldwide, especially in industries requiring robust text processing and system automation, including web development, bioinformatics, and network programming.
- CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network): Perl’s extensive library of modules is hosted globally through CPAN, which is widely used and mirrored across multiple servers worldwide.
### HOW
- Interpreted Language: Perl is an interpreted language, which means it can be executed directly without the need for prior compilation.
- Regular Expressions: It has powerful built-in support for regular expressions, making it a favorite for text processing tasks.
- CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network): Launched in 1995, CPAN is a repository of Perl modules and libraries, fostering a rich ecosystem of reusable code.
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- CGI (Common Gateway Interface): Perl became a popular language for writing CGI scripts in the 1990s, allowing web servers to generate dynamic content.
- Web Frameworks: Several web frameworks like Mason, Catalyst, and Dancer emerged, facilitating web development in Perl.
- System Administration: Widely used in system administration tasks for scripting and automation.

## PHP
### WHO
- Developed by: Rasmus Lerdorf, a Danish-Canadian programmer.
#### Key Figures:
- Rasmus Lerdorf: Created PHP originally as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries to track visitors to his online resume.
### WHAT
- PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): A server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
- Embedded Language: PHP code can be embedded within HTML, making it easy to create dynamic web content.
### WHY
- Dynamic Web Pages: PHP was created to enable developers to easily generate dynamic web pages and manage server-side logic.
- Simplicity: Designed to be easy to learn for newcomers while offering powerful features for advanced users.
### WHEN
- Development Start: PHP was originally created in 1994.
- Version Releases:
    - PHP 3 was released in 1998, establishing PHP as a robust scripting language for web development.
    - PHP 5, released in 2004, introduced many new features, including improved object-oriented programming support.
### WHERE
- Canada: Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of PHP, initially developed PHP while living in Canada. It started as a set of CGI scripts to track visitors to his personal website.
- Global Web Hosting Environments: PHP became ubiquitous on web servers around the world due to its ease of embedding within HTML, enabling millions of websites to offer dynamic content.
- Open Source Communities Worldwide: PHP’s vast global adoption is reflected in its widespread use in popular platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are hosted on web servers globally.
### HOW
- Interpreted Language: Like Perl, PHP is an interpreted language executed on the server side.
- Database Integration: PHP has strong support for various databases, especially MySQL, allowing developers to create data-driven applications easily.
- Frameworks: Popular frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter provide tools and structures for building PHP applications efficiently.
### EXAMPLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
- Content Management Systems (CMS): PHP powers many popular CMS platforms, including WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, enabling users to build and manage websites easily.
- E-Commerce Platforms: Platforms like Magento and WooCommerce are built on PHP, facilitating online commerce.
- Web Applications: Many dynamic websites and applications are developed using PHP due to its ease of use and rapid development capabilities.

### IMPORTANCE
- Web Development: Both Perl and PHP have played significant roles in the evolution of server-side web development, allowing developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications.
- Legacy and Community: Both languages have robust communities and extensive libraries/modules (CPAN for Perl and Packagist for PHP), fostering continuous development and support.
- Integration: Both languages facilitate integration with various databases and external services, making them versatile choices for web applications.
