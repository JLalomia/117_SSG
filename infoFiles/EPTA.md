# History Behind Early Programs and Technologies on ARPANET
## Gopher (1991)
### WHO
- Mark P. McCahill and a team from the University of Minnesota: Developed Gopher in 1991.
### WHAT
- Gopher: A text-based interface and protocol designed to organize and retrieve documents across the internet. Gopher was an early system for browsing and sharing information on the internet, pre-dating the World Wide Web (WWW).
    - It allowed users to search for and retrieve files (mainly text files) stored on remote servers in a hierarchical menu structure.
### WHY
- Simplified Information Access: Gopher was created to provide an easier way to browse, organize, and access information on the internet, which was rapidly growing. Before graphical web browsers, Gopher provided a clean, organized way to find and download files without a graphical interface.
- User-Friendly Interface: It offered a more structured and user-friendly way to access information compared to earlier technologies like Telnet and FTP, which required more technical knowledge.
### WHEN
- 1991: Gopher was created and introduced by the University of Minnesota. It gained popularity in the early 1990s, but its use declined after the World Wide Web became widely accessible.
### WHERE
- University of Minnesota: Gopher was developed and launched at this university, and it was adopted by universities and libraries around the world to organize and access information.
### HOW
- Menu-Based Interface: Gopher organized information hierarchically, with menus of text links to files or directories.
- Client-Server Model: Users accessed Gopher via a client (software) that connected to a Gopher server, which hosted the documents.
### EXAMPLES
- University Libraries: Gopher was commonly used by universities and libraries to create structured repositories of documents, files, and research papers.
- Decline: By the mid-1990s, Gopher was largely overshadowed by the World Wide Web, which introduced hyperlinks and graphical interfaces, making it easier to use and more versatile than Gopher.
## Telnet & FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
### WHO
- Telnet: Developed in 1969 as one of the first protocols used on ARPANET. It allowed remote login from one computer to another.
- FTP: Developed by Abhay Bhushan in 1971 as a protocol to transfer files across ARPANET.
### WHAT
- Telnet: A protocol that allowed users to connect to a remote server or computer over the ARPANET. It provided command-line access to the remote system, which allowed users to control it as if they were sitting in front of the terminal.
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A protocol used for transferring files between computers. It allowed users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers.
### WHY
- Telnet: The need to remotely control computers, especially in research environments, where users needed access to powerful machines from distant locations.
- FTP: Facilitated file sharing and collaboration among researchers and institutions. It allowed efficient transfer of documents, software, and research data over ARPANET.
### WHEN
- Telnet: Introduced in 1969 and became a standard tool for remote communication.
- FTP: Introduced in 1971 and has evolved over time, remaining in use today.
### WHERE
- Telnet and FTP were used on ARPANET in research institutions, universities, and later, military and government organizations around the U.S.
### HOW
- Telnet: Provided remote command-line access by establishing a terminal connection to a distant computer, allowing users to execute commands on that machine as if they were physically present.
- FTP: Allowed users to connect to a remote server and transfer files using commands like GET (to download) and PUT (to upload).
### EXAMPLES
- Telnet: Used by researchers to access mainframes and large computers remotely to run experiments and process data.
- FTP: Widely used for file sharing in academic and governmental networks. Today, FTP is still used for web development to upload files to servers.
## NCP (Network Control Protocol)
### WHO
- Developed by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), implemented in ARPANET in collaboration with Leonard Kleinrock, Lawrence Roberts, and others involved in ARPANET’s early development.
### WHAT
- NCP (Network Control Protocol): The protocol used to control communication between hosts on ARPANET before the development of TCP/IP. It allowed computers to establish connections and transmit data over the network.
### WHY
- Early Communication: ARPANET needed a protocol to manage and control communications between the various computers connected to the network. NCP was the solution to this need, enabling the first host-to-host communication.
### WHEN
- Early 1970s: NCP was implemented in ARPANET between 1970 and 1973.
- Replaced by TCP/IP in 1983: As networks grew and became more complex, NCP was eventually replaced by TCP/IP, which was more flexible and scalable.
### WHERE
- NCP was used across ARPANET, the early network connecting universities and research labs in the U.S.
### HOW
- Host-to-Host Communication: NCP was responsible for establishing and managing connections between computers on ARPANET, handling communication details at a lower level.
### EXAMPLES
- ARPANET’s Early Days: NCP enabled early networked programs, such as remote login via Telnet, file sharing via FTP, and email. It was key to ARPANET’s success in the early 1970s.
- Transition to TCP/IP: By 1983, NCP was phased out in favor of TCP/IP, which could handle the growing demands of an increasingly global network.
## IMPORTANCE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES
- Foundation of Early Internet: Technologies like Gopher, Telnet, FTP, and NCP formed the foundation of the internet, enabling communication, file transfer, and access to remote systems.
- Evolution: While technologies like NCP were replaced by more advanced protocols like TCP/IP, and Gopher was replaced by the World Wide Web, these early innovations were crucial to the development of the internet we know today.
- Decentralized Communication: The development of protocols like NCP and later TCP/IP was key to creating a decentralized and resilient internet, capable of surviving disruptions or attacks, a critical concern during the Cold War era.
