                    <h3>WHO</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Web Hosting Providers:</strong> Early providers like GeoCities and Tripod offered users a simple way to create and host websites. Later, more sophisticated providers offered shared and dedicated hosting.</li>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities:</strong> Founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner in 1994, it was one of the first major web hosting platforms that allowed users to create and manage their own websites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tripod:</strong> Launched in 1995 by Bo Peabody and Brett Hershey, it started as a site for college students but later expanded to offer free web hosting.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> Developed by J. Nicholas Koston in 1996, cPanel revolutionized website management by providing an easy-to-use graphical interface for users to manage their web hosting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHAT">
                    <h3>WHAT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities & Tripod:</strong> Early web hosting services that provided free or inexpensive web space to users. They allowed people without advanced technical knowledge to create and publish personal or small business websites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> A type of web hosting where multiple websites are hosted on the same server, sharing resources like bandwidth and storage. It is cheaper but can be slower if one site uses too many resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> A more powerful and expensive option where an entire server is dedicated to one website, offering more control, faster performance, and higher security.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> A web hosting control panel that allows users to manage their server settings, files, databases, email, and other aspects of web hosting through a graphical user interface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHY">
                    <h3>WHY</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities & Tripod:</strong> In the early days of the web, many people lacked the technical skills to create a website from scratch. GeoCities and Tripod made it easy for users to create and host simple websites without needing to know how to code or manage servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> As more people wanted to build websites, shared hosting provided a cost-effective solution for users who didn’t need the power of a dedicated server. It allowed hosting companies to offer affordable plans by hosting multiple sites on the same server.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> For larger businesses or websites with high traffic, shared hosting was often insufficient. Dedicated hosting offered more performance and customization.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> It simplified the management of web servers, especially for people who were not well-versed in server administration. cPanel offered an easy way to control key aspects of a website like file management, security, and databases.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHEN">
                    <h3>WHEN</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1994-1995:</strong> GeoCities and Tripod were launched in the mid-1990s, making web hosting more accessible to the average person.</li>
                        <li><strong>Late 1990s:</strong> The concept of shared hosting and dedicated hosting evolved as more businesses and individuals wanted to create websites with custom domain names and more control.</li>
                        <li><strong>1996:</strong> cPanel was introduced, which drastically simplified web hosting management by allowing users to interact with a graphical interface instead of using command-line tools.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHERE">
                    <h3>WHERE</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities:</strong> Founded in Beverly Hills, California, GeoCities became a massive global platform for web hosting. It was eventually acquired by Yahoo! in 1999.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tripod:</strong> Based in Williamstown, Massachusetts, Tripod began as a service aimed at college students but grew into a broader web hosting platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared/Dedicated Hosting:</strong> Offered by web hosting companies worldwide, these services became the foundation of the commercial web hosting industry. Companies like Bluehost, HostGator, and GoDaddy later capitalized on these models.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> Developed in Texas, cPanel became widely used across hosting providers around the world, offering users an intuitive way to manage their websites.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="HOW">
                    <h3>HOW</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities & Tripod:</strong> These platforms allowed users to create personal websites by offering templates, pre-configured design tools, and free hosting. Users could set up web pages with minimal effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> Multiple websites are hosted on a single server. Web hosts manage the server’s software, maintenance, and updates, while users share the cost of the server’s resources. It’s ideal for smaller websites that don’t need full server control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> A website owner rents an entire server, gaining full control over its resources, configuration, and security. This provides better performance, higher reliability, and the ability to handle large amounts of traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> It uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to manage the hosting environment. Users can handle everything from setting up emails to managing databases like MySQL, configuring FTP, and handling file permissions through an easy-to-navigate dashboard.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GeoCities:</strong> By the time Yahoo! bought GeoCities in 1999, it was hosting 38 million web pages, showing how popular and important it had become in helping early internet users get online.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tripod:</strong> As another pioneer in web hosting, Tripod allowed millions of users to host personal pages, with features like guestbooks, message boards, and hit counters—common elements of 1990s web pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> Platforms like Bluehost and HostGator offered shared hosting plans for as little as $3-$5 per month, democratizing access to web hosting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> High-traffic websites, such as early e-commerce sites, used dedicated hosting to ensure their sites were always up and running efficiently without being slowed down by other users on a shared server.</li>
                        <li><strong>cPanel:</strong> cPanel remains one of the most popular web hosting control panels used by hosting companies worldwide. It supports a wide range of features and tools for users to manage their websites, emails, and databases effectively.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>IMPORTANCE</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> GeoCities, Tripod, and similar web hosting services opened up the web to everyday people, making it easy for anyone to create and host a website without deep technical knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As websites became more sophisticated and required more resources, shared and dedicated hosting solutions allowed websites to scale according to their needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Tools like cPanel made it easier for users to manage complex aspects of web hosting, greatly lowering the barrier to entry for people who wanted to manage their own websites.</li>
