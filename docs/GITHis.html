                    <h2>WHO</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Developed by</strong>: Linus Torvalds, a Finnish-American software engineer.</li>
                        <li>Key Figures:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>: Creator of Git and the Linux operating system, known for his influential work in open-source software development.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Git</strong>: A distributed version control system designed to handle projects of all sizes efficiently. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Git tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and branching.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHY">
                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Need for Better Version Control</strong>: Torvalds created Git to manage the development of the Linux kernel more effectively, addressing limitations in previous version control systems like BitKeeper, which had licensing issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Speed and Efficiency</strong>: Git was designed to be fast, with strong support for branching and merging, which are essential for collaborative development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHEN">
                    <h2>WHEN</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Development Start</strong>: Git was created in April 2005.</li>
                        <li><strong>First Release</strong>: The first version of Git (0.1) was released in April 2005.</li>
                        <li><strong>Widespread Adoption</strong>: Git gained popularity rapidly, especially in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as more projects and developers began to recognize its benefits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHERE">
                    <h2>WHERE</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finland:</strong></li> Git was created by Linus Torvalds while he was working on the development of the Linux kernel, which originated in Finland.
                        <li><strong>Worldwide Use:</strong></li> Git quickly gained global adoption, especially in open-source projects like the Linux kernel, and is now used by millions of developers across the world in various industries, including technology, finance, and entertainment.
                        <li><strong>GitHub:</strong></li> Git’s widespread adoption led to the creation of GitHub, a popular platform for hosting Git repositories, which is used by developers and companies worldwide to manage and collaborate on code projects.
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="HOW">
                    <h2>HOW</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Distributed Architecture</strong>: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed, meaning every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history, enabling offline work and faster operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Snapshot-Based</strong>: Git stores data as snapshots of the file system at a given point in time rather than as a series of changes, making it easier to manage and retrieve previous versions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Branching and Merging</strong>: Git allows easy creation of branches for experimentation, enabling developers to work on features independently before merging them back into the main codebase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="EX">

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Open Source Projects</strong>: Many open-source projects, including the Linux kernel, are developed using Git, demonstrating its capability to handle large-scale collaborative efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>GitHub</strong>: Git's popularity led to the creation of platforms like GitHub, which provides a user-friendly interface for Git repositories and fosters collaboration among developers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment</strong>: Git integrates well with CI/CD tools, making it an essential component of modern software development workflows.</li>
