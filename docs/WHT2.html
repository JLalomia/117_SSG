                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Hosting</strong>: A web hosting solution that uses a network of virtual servers hosted in the cloud to store and manage data. It provides flexibility, scalability, and reliability, allowing users to pay for what they use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Hosting</strong>: A type of web hosting where multiple websites share the same server resources. It is cost-effective but can lead to slower performance if one site experiences high traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting</strong>: A hosting environment that mimics a dedicated server within a shared hosting environment. VPS hosting offers greater control, privacy, and performance compared to shared hosting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dedicated Hosting</strong>: A hosting option where an entire server is rented for a single client. This provides maximum performance, security, and control but comes at a higher cost.</li>
