                </section>
                <section id="WHY">
                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Need for Standardization</strong>: As JavaScript gained popularity in the mid-1990s, the need for a standardized specification arose to ensure consistency across different implementations and improve interoperability among web browsers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing Improvements</strong>: The evolution of web development practices and user needs necessitated regular updates to the JavaScript language, introducing new features, syntax improvements, and better performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHEN">

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ECMAScript Standardization</strong>: The first edition of ECMAScript was published in June 1997.</li>
                        <li><strong>ECMAScript 3 (ES3)</strong>: Released in December 1999, it was the most widely implemented version at the time, introducing features like regular expressions and try/catch for error handling.</li>
                        <li><strong>ECMAScript 5 (ES5)</strong>: Released in December 2009, it introduced significant features like "strict mode," JSON support, and new array methods.</li>
                        <li><strong>ECMAScript 6 (ES6 or ECMAScript 2015)</strong>: Released in June 2015, this major update introduced classes, modules, arrow functions, and other features, significantly modernizing the language.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHERE">
