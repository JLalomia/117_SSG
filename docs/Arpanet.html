                    <h2>WHO</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Developed by:</strong> The United States Department of Defense’s ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), specifically its Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO).</li>
                            <li><strong>ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency):</strong> Funded and oversaw the development of ARPANET. ARPA is part of the U.S. Department of Defense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Key Figures:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>J.C.R. Licklider:</strong> An early advocate for computer networking and interactive computing, who envisioned a network of computers.</li>

                            <li><strong>Leonard Kleinrock:</strong> Played a significant role in packet-switching theory and the first message sent over ARPANET.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bob Taylor:</strong> Director at ARPA who pushed for the creation of a network that would allow computers to share resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Larry Roberts:</strong> A key ARPA scientist responsible for developing ARPANET’s design and implementation.</li>

                <section id="WHAT">
                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ARPANET:</strong> The first operational packet-switching network, which laid the groundwork for the modern internet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Packet Switching:</strong> A method of grouping data into packets that are sent over a network and reassembled at the destination, allowing efficient data transmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creation of ARPANET:</strong> ARPANET was designed to allow multiple computers to communicate over long distances without requiring a direct connection between them. It introduced the concept of packet switching, where data is broken into smaller packets that are sent across different routes and reassembled at the destination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The original goal was to connect research institutions to share computing resources, facilitate collaboration, and increase the resilience of communication networks in the event of disruptions, including military attacks.</li>
                        </ul>

                <section id="WHY">
                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Need for Communication:</strong> To facilitate communication and resource sharing among research institutions and military organizations in the U.S. during the Cold War.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> To create a communication system that could withstand potential disruptions (like a nuclear attack), making it resilient against failures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> The primary motivation was to allow researchers at different institutions to share expensive computing resources, such as supercomputers, which were not widely available.</li>
                            <li><strong>Military Necessity:</strong> The network was also seen as a way to ensure communication survivability in the event of military conflict, specifically a nuclear attack, which might destroy centralized communication hubs. Decentralized communication would allow messages to be routed even if parts of the network were destroyed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Innovation in Networking:</strong> ARPANET also served as a testbed for new ideas about computer networking, data transmission, and resource sharing.</li>

                        <li><strong>Funding and Development:</strong> ARPA funded research at various universities and private contractors, encouraging collaboration and innovation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Network Design:</strong> ARPANET was designed using a decentralized architecture, allowing multiple nodes to communicate without relying on a central hub.</li>
                        <li><strong>Packet Switching:</strong> ARPANET used packet switching, breaking down data into small packets, sending them individually across the network, and reassembling them at their destination. This was more efficient and resilient than the traditional circuit-switched systems used by telephone networks.</li>
                        <li><strong>IMP (Interface Message Processors):</strong> ARPANET used IMPs, specialized computers that handled the routing of packets between nodes. These devices made packet switching possible by routing data across the network.</li>
                        <li><strong>First Message:</strong> On October 29, 1969, the first message sent over ARPANET was “LO” (the system crashed after the first two letters of "LOGIN" were transmitted) from UCLA to Stanford.</li>
