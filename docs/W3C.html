                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>W3C</strong>: An international standards organization that develops protocols and guidelines to ensure the long-term growth of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mission</strong>: The W3C’s goal is to lead the web to its full potential by creating open standards and guidelines that ensure the web remains accessible, secure, and compatible across different platforms and devices.</li>

                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Need for Standardization</strong>: In the early days of the web, there was a proliferation of different web technologies and proprietary extensions by browser companies (like Microsoft and Netscape), causing compatibility issues. Web pages often did not look the same across different browsers, leading to a fragmented user experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Berners-Lee recognized the need for a central body to create open, non-proprietary standards to ensure that the web remained interoperable. The goal was to prevent the web from becoming fragmented or controlled by any single entity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Accessibility and Growth</strong>: The W3C was also established to promote an open, inclusive web that could be used by anyone, regardless of their language, location, device, or abilities.</li>
