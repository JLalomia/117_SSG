                        <ul>
                            <li>Tim Berners-Lee: A British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web. He developed the foundational technologies that made the web possible while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research).</li>

                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> A markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the format of web pages using elements such as paragraphs, headers, links, images, and other media.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Key Function:</strong> HTML allows the embedding of hyperlinks (connections to other pages), creating a network of linked content.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> The communication protocol that governs the exchange of information between a client (browser) and a web server.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Key Function:</strong> HTTP enables browsers to request web pages from servers and display them to users. It defines how requests are made (GET, POST) and how responses are sent.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</strong> The addressing system used to identify and locate resources (such as web pages, images, or documents) on the internet.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Key Function:</strong> A URL provides a unique address that specifies where resources can be found on the web and how to access them (through HTTP or other protocols).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organizing and Sharing Information: Tim Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web was to create a global information system where documents and data could be easily linked and accessed via the internet. Prior to the web, information on the internet was scattered and difficult to navigate.</li>
                            <li>Hypertext Concept: He was inspired by the concept of hypertext, which allowed for the linking of documents in a non-linear way, making it easy for users to browse through related information by following links.</li>
                        </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHEN">
                    <h2>WHEN</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1989: Tim Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web while working at CERN. His goal was to create a system for managing information in a way that was accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</li>
                            <li>1990: He developed the first web browser (WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus), the first web server, and the core technologies HTML, HTTP, and URL.</li>
                            <li>1991: The World Wide Web was officially made public, and the first website was launched at CERN.</li>
                        </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="WHERE">
                    <h2>WHERE</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research): Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web while working at this research facility in Switzerland. CERN was an ideal environment for the creation of the web, as it had a large community of scientists who needed to share and access research data easily.</li>
                        </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="HOW">
                    <h2>HOW</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Berners-Lee created HTML as the basic building block of the web, allowing users to format text, insert links, and include media in web pages.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>HTML documents are structured with tags that define different elements like paragraphs (< p >), headings (< h1 >), and links (< a >).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>HTTP:</strong> He designed HTTP as a lightweight, stateless protocol that could send requests from a browser to a server, asking for web pages or files.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For example, a GET request from a browser would retrieve the HTML file that makes up a web page, which is then rendered and displayed to the user.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>URL:</strong> The URL format, which he devised, specifies the location of a resource on the web. A typical URL includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Protocol (e.g., `http://`),</li>
                                    <li>Domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`),</li>
                                    <li>Path (e.g., `/page.html`) to the specific resource.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>First Website:</strong> The first website, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, was dedicated to explaining the World Wide Web project. It included links to web-related documentation and guidelines for building websites. The URL of this first website was <code>http://info.cern.ch</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>WWW Today:</strong> These core technologies (HTML, HTTP, and URLs) form the backbone of the modern web. Nearly every web page you visit today uses HTML for structure, HTTP/HTTPS for communication, and URLs to locate resources.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Global Information Access:</strong> The World Wide Web revolutionized how we access and share information. It transformed the internet from a network for researchers and tech experts into a global, user-friendly system that anyone could use to browse and publish content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Foundation of Modern Web:</strong> HTML, HTTP, and URLs are the fundamental building blocks of the modern web. HTML has evolved (with modern versions like HTML5) to include multimedia and interactivity, but the core principles remain the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interconnected Information:</strong> The ability to link documents using hyperlinks has made it possible to create a global, interconnected web of information. This concept is central to the Web as we know it today, where billions of web pages are linked together and accessible from anywhere.</li>
