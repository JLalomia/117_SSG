<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <!-- 
      The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page.
      The 'lang' attribute declares the language of the document's content.

      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <!-- 
          The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
          UTF-8 is a standard encoding that supports most characters from all written languages.
          This ensures that text is displayed correctly.

      <!-- 
          The <meta name="viewport"> tag controls how the webpage is displayed on mobile devices.
          - 'width=device-width' sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
          - 'initial-scale=1.0' sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
          This is crucial for responsive web design, ensuring the site looks good on all devices.

          The <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"> tag is used to specify the version of Internet Explorer that the page should be rendered with.
          'content="ie=edge"' tells IE to use the latest rendering engine.
          This helps in avoiding compatibility issues with older versions of IE.

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
      <!-- 
          The <link> tag links external resources to the HTML document.
          - 'rel="stylesheet"' specifies that the linked file is a CSS stylesheet.
          - 'href="style.css"' provides the path to the CSS file.
          This stylesheet controls the visual presentation of the HTML elements on the page.

      <body>
        
        <h1>Linux and GIT Student Survival Guide</h1>
        <!-- 
            The <h1> tag defines the most important heading on the page.
            Headings help organize content and improve accessibility.
            "Linux and GIT Student Survival Guide" is the main title displayed prominently.

        <ul>
          <!-- 
              The <ul> tag defines an unordered list, which is a collection of list items marked with bullets.
              It's useful for listing items that don't require a specific order.

          <ul>
            
            <li><a href="git.html">GIT List</a></li>
            <!-- 
                The <li> tag defines a single item within a list.
                Inside <li>, the <a> tag creates a hyperlink.
                - 'href="git.html"' specifies the destination URL when the link is clicked.
                - "GIT List" is the clickable text that users see.
                This link navigates to the "git.html" page, presumably containing a list related to GIT.
            -->
            <li><a href="git.html">GIT List</a></li>

            <!-- 
                Another list item containing a link.
                - 'href="linux.html"' directs the link to the "linux.html" page.
                - "Linux List" is the visible text for the link.
                This likely leads to a page with a list of Linux-related resources or information.
            -->
            <li><a href="linux.html">Linux List</a></li>

        <script src="js/main.js"></script>
        <!-- 
            The <script> tag is used to embed or reference executable scripts, typically JavaScript.
            - 'src="js/main.js"' specifies the path to the external JavaScript file.
            Placing scripts just before the closing </body> tag is a common practice to ensure that the HTML content loads before the scripts execute.
            This can improve page load times and ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before the script runs.
