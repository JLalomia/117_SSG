                                    <li><strong>Gopher:</strong> A text-based interface and protocol designed to organize and retrieve documents across the internet. Gopher was an early system for browsing and sharing information on the internet, pre-dating the World Wide Web (WWW).

                                    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> It offered a more structured and user-friendly way to access information compared to earlier technologies like Telnet and FTP, which required more technical knowledge.</li>
