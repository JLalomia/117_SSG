                                <li>J.C.R. Licklider (1915-1990) was an American psychologist and computer scientist, often referred to as one of the "fathers of the internet". His ideas shaped the development of interactive computing and networking.</li>
                                <li>Position: Licklider was the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), now DARPA.</li>

                        <h2>WHAT</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Licklider is best known for his work on interactive computing and the concept of a "man-computer symbiosis"—the idea that computers should enhance human intellect and allow people to interact directly with machines.</li>
                                <li>Conceptualized the "Intergalactic Computer Network": Licklider envisioned a global network of computers that could communicate and share information in real-time. His idea was one of the first conceptual foundations for the internet.</li>
                                <li>Role in the Development of ARPANET: Licklider's vision of connected computers heavily influenced the creation of ARPANET, the predecessor of the modern internet.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>As the head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at DARPA, he funded early research into time-sharing computers and networking.</li>
                                    </ul>

                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information Sharing and Collaboration: Licklider believed that computers could transform human communication and collaboration by enabling people to share data and knowledge more easily across distances.</li>
                            <li>Solving Global Problems: He saw computer networks as a way to share resources and tackle global issues, like science, education, and economics, more efficiently.</li>
                            <li>Licklider believed that computers should not just be tools for calculation but partners in human problem-solving. He wanted to make computers more accessible, user-friendly, and connected, facilitating collaboration among people across different locations.</li>
                            <li>His vision was driven by a belief that such technology would lead to a better understanding and use of human knowledge.</li>

                                <li>Early 1960s: Licklider's most significant contributions began when he joined ARPA in 1962, where he pushed for research into networking computers.</li>
                                <li>1963: Licklider published memos outlining his vision for an "Intergalactic Computer Network," which became the intellectual foundation for computer networking.</li>
                                <li>In the 1960s, during his time at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), Licklider’s ideas began to influence the course of computer science.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>His landmark paper, "Man-Computer Symbiosis," was published in 1960, laying the groundwork for his future contributions.</li>
                                        <li>Licklider’s direct influence on networking, especially ARPANET, happened from 1962-1964, when he was at DARPA. He also returned to DARPA in 1973 for a second stint.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <li>Through his role at DARPA, Licklider secured funding and support for key researchers and projects that laid the foundation for modern computing and networking (e.g., time-sharing systems, packet switching).</li>
                                <li>His management style encouraged collaboration between academic institutions, government, and private industry, helping to bring together the community that would later develop the internet.</li>
                                <li>He was an early proponent of time-sharing systems, allowing multiple users to interact with a single computer system simultaneously—a precursor to modern computing environments.</li>
                                <li>Promoting Collaborative Research: Licklider worked to promote a vision of decentralized computing, encouraging collaborative research across institutions.</li>
                                <li>Funding and Vision: As the director of IPTO, he allocated funding to projects that contributed to networking and time-sharing technologies, such as Project MAC at MIT, which helped develop early computing innovations.</li>

                                <li>ARPANET: Licklider’s vision of a connected system of computers became reality with the development of ARPANET in the late 1960s, which eventually evolved into the internet.</li>
                                <li>"Man-Computer Symbiosis": His 1960 paper was a foundational work envisioning the close collaboration between humans and machines, which still resonates today in fields like human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence.</li>
                                <li>Time-sharing systems: Licklider’s push for time-sharing computers led to the development of systems that allowed multiple people to use computers at once, moving away from batch processing, making computers much more user-friendly.</li>
                                <li>Intergalactic Computer Network Vision: Though never implemented in its original form, Licklider’s vision of a global network of computers was an intellectual predecessor to the modern internet, especially the idea of distributed computing and interconnectedness.</li>
