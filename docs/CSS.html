                        <h2>WHO</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed by: Håkon Wium Lie while working at CERN with Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Key Figures:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Håkon Wium Lie: The main creator of CSS and an influential figure in web standards.</li>
                            <li>Bert Bos: Collaborated with Lie and contributed to the development of CSS, especially in its early specifications.</li>

                        <h2>WHAT</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML or XML. It controls the visual style of web content, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section id="WHY">
                        <h2>WHY</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Improved Web Design:</strong> There was a need for a standardized way to control the appearance of web pages, which were previously styled using inline HTML attributes and deprecated tags.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> CSS provides a more efficient way to manage styles across multiple pages, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <h2>WHEN</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Development Start:</strong> CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994.</li>
                            <li><strong>First Specification:</strong> The first CSS specification, CSS1, was officially published in December 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
                            <li><strong>Major Versions:</strong> CSS2 was released in 1998, followed by CSS2.1 in 2011, and CSS3 introduced modular specifications starting in 1999.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>WHERE</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research):</strong> CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie while working at CERN, the same institution where the World Wide Web was initially developed by Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
                            <li><strong>(World Wide Web Consortium):</strong> The development and standardization of CSS were overseen by the W3C, a global organization that develops open web standards. CSS1 was officially published by the W3C in 1996.</li>
                            <li><strong>University of Oslo:</strong> Håkon Wium Lie, after his time at CERN, continued his work on CSS at the University of Oslo, contributing to its early development and adoption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Global Adoption:</strong> CSS quickly became a standard in web design and was adopted by developers worldwide, allowing web pages to have consistent visual styling across different browsers and platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stylesheets:</strong> CSS can be applied inline within HTML, embedded in the `<head>` section of an HTML document, or linked as an external stylesheet, promoting flexibility and modular design.</li>
                            <li><strong>Selectors and Properties:</strong> CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply properties that define how they should be displayed, such as color, font-size, margin, and padding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cascading Order:</strong> CSS follows a cascading order where styles can inherit and override based on specificity and importance, allowing for flexible and hierarchical styling.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS has evolved to support responsive design techniques, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices using media queries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grid and Flexbox Layouts:</strong> New layout models such as CSS Grid and Flexbox (introduced in the 2010s) revolutionized web design by providing powerful tools for creating complex, responsive layouts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Animations and Transitions:</strong> CSS introduced capabilities for animations and transitions, enabling designers to create dynamic and visually appealing effects without relying on JavaScript.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preprocessors:</strong> Tools like Sass and LESS have emerged to extend CSS's functionality, adding features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which enhance code organization and reusability.</li>
