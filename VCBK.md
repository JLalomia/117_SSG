## History Behind Vint Cerf and Bob Khan
### WHO
#### Vint Cerf
* Vinton Gray Cerf (born 1943) is an American computer scientist, widely known as one of the "fathers of the internet"
* He is currently Google's Chief Internet Evangelist and has contributed to various internet policy initiatives
#### Bob Khan
* Robert Elliot Kahn (born 1938) is an American electrical engineer and computer scientist
* He is another of the "fathers of the internet," who co-created the TCP/IP protocols with Vint Cerf

### WHAT
#### Vint Cerf
* Vint Cerf co-developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), the fundamental technology that makes the internet possible
* He worked alongside Bob Kahn on this project while at DARPA
* Cerf has been involved in global efforts to expand and maintain the internet, advocating for its openness and neutrality
#### Bob Khan
* Kahn developed the concept of a "network of networks" (internetworking) and led the team that created the ARPANET
* He co-invented the TCP/IP protocols with Vint Cerf

### WHY
#### Vint Cerf
* Cerf aimed to solve the issue of connecting different types of computer networks into a single global network
* He wanted to create a system that could enable communication across diverse and geographically distributed computer systems, without centralized control
#### Bob Khan
* Kahn was looking for a way to connect different computer networks with varying architectures (local area networks, satellite networks, etc.) into a unified system
* The goal was to ensure reliable data transmission across heterogeneous networks, solving communication issues in distributed systems

### WHEN
#### Vint Cerf
* Cerf and Kahn began their work on TCP/IP in 1973
* The protocol was finalized in 1978 and became the standard for ARPANET in 1983, eventually forming the basis of the modern internet
#### Bob Khan
* Kahn first conceived of the internet's "network of networks" architecture in the early 1970s
* He began collaborating with Cerf in 1973, leading to the development of TCP/IP
* ARPANET adopted TCP/IP as its standard in 1983, which laid the foundation for the modern internet

### HOW
#### Vint Cerf
* Cerf and Kahn designed TCP/IP to handle the technical challenges of internetworking, specifically packet-switched data transmission across various networks
* TCP handles breaking data into packets and reassembling them, while IP ensures the packets are routed to the right destination
#### Bob Khan
* Kahn developed the open-architecture networking approach, meaning that different networks could be interconnected without needing to change their internal structure
* Together with Cerf, he designed TCP/IP to handle end-to-end data transmission between computers, regardless of the underlying network infrastructure

### EXAMPLES
#### Vint Cerf
* TCP/IP: The most important contribution, enabling the global expansion of the internet and the interconnection of networks worldwide
* Internet Society (ISOC): Cerf co-founded ISOC in 1992, a nonprofit organization that promotes the open development of the internet
#### Bob Khan
* ARPANET: Kahn played a significant role in its early design and development, which evolved into the internet
* TCP/IP: The standard communication protocol suite that forms the backbone of the modern internet
* CNRI (Corporation for National Research Initiatives): Kahn founded CNRI in 1986 to foster the development of network-based technologies and promote internet research
### Both
* TCP/IP: Both Cerf and Kahn collaborated to invent TCP/IP, which is the core protocol of the internet
* Internet Growth: Their work made it possible for diverse computer networks around the world to interconnect, which led to the rapid growth of the internet in the 1990s
* Influence on Modern Technology: The principles they developed are fundamental to modern technologies such as email, web browsing, and online streaming
